Task-3 : Voice Assistant

This Python script creates a voice assistant using speech recognition and text-to-speech modules. It listens for user commands through the microphone, recognizing speech with Google's service, and performs corresponding actions. Functions like speak() and listen() handle text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion. The execute_command() function manages responses to specific commands such as greetings and farewells. The main() function starts the assistant, greeting the user, and continues listening for commands until a goodbye command is given. If understood, it triggers the appropriate response; otherwise, it indicates a failure to comprehend. When executed directly, the script begins the assistant.
